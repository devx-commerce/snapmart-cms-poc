/**
 * Who changed what, when.
 *
 * Payload has no native audit log. Its `versions` feature stores a full snapshot of the
 * document at each save, which answers *what it looked like* and *when* -- but the version
 * tables carry no user column at all, so it cannot answer *who*. Verified against the
 * running schema: `_product_content_v` has `created_at`, `latest`, `autosave` and the
 * version_* payload, and nothing identifying an author.
 *
 * An official Audit Logs feature exists but is part of Payload's paid Enterprise offering.
 *
 * THREE PROPERTIES MAKE THIS AN AUDIT LOG RATHER THAN A CHANGE FEED
 *
 * 1. It is immutable. Nobody -- including an admin -- can create, edit or delete an entry
 *    through the API or the panel. Entries are written by the hook using `overrideAccess`,
 *    which is the only path in. An audit trail an administrator can quietly edit is not
 *    evidence of anything.
 *
 * 2. It denormalises the actor. `userEmail` is copied in at write time rather than only
 *    holding a relationship, so deleting a user does not erase who made the change. The
 *    relationship is kept as well, for filtering while the user still exists.
 *
 * 3. It records the field-level diff, not just that "something changed".
